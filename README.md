## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process
- I started with the design and later applied the functionality. 

### Built with
- React
- JSX Components
- No bootstrap for simplicity
- SCSS, mixins, and custom variables
- Flexbox, Grid
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- React-Leaflet
- IPfy API
- Node modules to hide the API key

### What I learned
- Discovered how easy-to-use Flexbox is. Was previously using grid only
- Got more familiar with Fetch
- Learned how to hide API keys in .env
- Discovered and worked around some CSS quirks
- how React useMemo works, but realized it wasn't needed in my project

### Continued development
- I want to be able to better identify when Flexbox over Grid is preferable
